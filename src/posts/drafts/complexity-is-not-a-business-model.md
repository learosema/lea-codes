Right now this is more a brainstorming about what I want to write about.

IT consulting companies and agencies building software often claim their mission is to build "complex business applications". I want to challenge that. At first glance it sounds like a great business model. It might work for a while, but it won't be a very sustainable business relationship.

No, it's not your job to help building complex software. Reducing complexity is key.

## Why do companies build overcomplex software?

- They falsely claim this as their mission
- They falsely claim the amount of complexity is required
- They believe building an over-engineered software creates a dependency to the customer
  - not a healthy customer relationship ("we work with you because we must, not)
- individuals want to sound smart in front of their supervisor
  - throwing as much design patterns as possible onto a problem for getting a promotion?
  - structural problem: you won't get a promotion with a line of CSS. Replace that line of CSS with 100kb of JavaScript and you get it.
- because $buzzword sounds good at marketing events

## Disadvantages of overcomplex software

- difficult to maintain
- long onboarding processes
- hard to get productive
- causes frustration
- over-complexity requires a lot of organization
- requires "superheros" to work on the software
  - high bus factors
  - leads to unrealistic profiles in job descriptions, scares off good developers
    (we need to hire a god who can do $allTheThings and we need it for tomorrow)
    - people who still apply are probably mostly men with strong egos
- adding features becomes a mess
- high risk of tech debt pile-up
- ableism: "you as a senior developer should be able to manage this level of complexity!"

## Challenging Single Page Applications

- what problems do single page applications try to solve?
- why are single page applications bad practice?
  - eg. slow, heavy CO2 footprint
- what are better approaches?
  
## Challenging Microfrontends

- what problems do microfrontends try to solve?
- why are microfrontends bad practice
- what are

## Design patterns Anti patterns

- Some people tend to stuff

## Key takeaway points

- never code alone
- you're not better than others
- don't be afraid to try out something new
- accept your own limits
