# My recent dabblings in DOS and why

If you follow my recent development activities. I coded a lot in C++ for DOS.

Why DOS?

- With me being an 80's child, I grew up with MS-DOS 5.00, floppy disks, and Second Reality
- DOS may be dead, but old DOS games are still super popular, thanks to GOG.com, who publishes
DOS games shipped with DOSBox.
- Thanks to DOSBox, DOS programs run anywhere. With DOSBox, it's sometimes even easier to run a DOS game on a Mac or Linux than a Windows application via WINE.
- I wanna explore cross platform development extreme :)
- Ultimately, there is an unpopular fact: MS-DOS may be dead, but FreeDOS is pretty much alive.

Why C++?

- C++ is still pretty popular among game developers and I basically want to get a step into the door :)
- I'm a bit fed up with webdev, where picking a framework like React/Angular is the default rather than html first
