## Information I collect

If you contact me directly, I may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send me, and any other information you may choose to provide.

I don't use any tracking cookies or any other logging. My provider does save IP addresses and access time stamps in an access log. Logs saved by my provider are not shared with me.

## How I use your information

I use the information I collect to:

- Communicate with you (only on consent when you send me an e-mail and expect a reply)
- Contact data will be deleted within 30 days

## CCPA Privacy Rights (Do Not Sell My Personal Information)

Under the CCPA, among other rights, California consumers have the right to:

Request that a business that collects a consumer's personal data disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal data that a business has collected about consumers.

Request that a business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.

Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.

If you make a request, I have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact me.

## GDPR Data Protection Rights

I would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:

The right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data. I may charge you a small fee for this service.

The right to rectification – You have the right to request that I correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request that I complete the information you believe is incomplete.

The right to erasure – You have the right to request that I erase your personal data, under certain conditions.

The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that I restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.

The right to object to processing – You have the right to object to my processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.

If you make a request, I have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact me.

## Children's Information

Another part of my priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. I encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

My website does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on my website, I strongly encourage you to contact me immediately and I will do my best efforts to promptly remove such information from the records.
