Hi, I'm Lea (she/her), working as a frontend developer with a focus on accessibility and web performance.

I'm based in Hamburg which is a beautiful but quite rainy city in the north of Germany.

## Things I do

In my spare time, I'm sitting in front of the computer. I have a [Codepen Profile](https://codepen.io/learosema/) where I love to experiment with web technologies and digital arts.

I wrote a WebGL library called [glea](https://github.com/learosema/glea), a vector/matrix arithmetics library called [ella-math](https://github.com/learosema/ella-math). A thing I often use is a [shader-art](https://github.com/shader-art/) web component for running webgl shaders with a few kilobytes of JavaScript. 

Apart from sitting in front of the computer, I love to cook and I love to go for a walk; there's no bad weather. At least you have to get used to the rain over here in the north of Germany ðŸ˜…. Also, I really love to hang out with people and just chat along.

## DON'Ts

- in direct messages and chats: don't say "Hello" and nothing else (see [https://nohello.net/](https://nohello.net/)).
- I'm also super uncomfortable with unsocilited flirts from people I don't know.
- No intimate questions if we don't know each other.
