# Lea's Blog

This is going to be a place to write for Lea. It is based on [eleventy-excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [Lene Saile](https://front-end.social/@lene).

## Tech stack

This site uses Eleventy and LightningCSS as a CSS preprocessor.
To get it running, use

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will open a dev server running on localhost:8080, watching for changes.

## GitHub actions

There are github actions for running automated checks on the code base, so I can be sure the HTML/CSS/JS are valid and also the formatting of the files are all respecting the provided editorconfig.

All credits of the automated checks go to [Vadim Makeev](https://github.com/pepelsbey/pepelsbey.dev).
